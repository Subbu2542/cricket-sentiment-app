de Klerk to Radha Yadav, out Deepti Sharma Run Out!! 1 run completed. Full toss and Radha Yadav swings for the fences and ends up losing her bat. Sliced down to sweeper cover and there was never a two in there. Both batters were in the middle of the pitch when the throw came into the keeper and Deepti was miles short. Deepti Sharma run out (Chloe Tryon/Sinalo Jafta) 58(58) [4s-3 6s-1]
de Klerk to Radha Yadav, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
49.5
de Klerk to Deepti Sharma, 1 run, Radha Yadav wanted a second, but Deepti was content with a single. She miscued the loft to long-on and it dropped just short of the incoming Wolvaardt at long-on. Deepti was ball-watching for a while, and didn't spot the opportunity to pinch a second. Radha Yadav was halfway down and a poor throw helped her get back to the crease...
Keval: Runs on the board always help in any final. Yes it may be 20-30 short of expected target still the onus is on South Africa to chase this. Exciting 50 overs coming ahead.

Richa played the pick up flick and hit it flat to deep square. Dercksen didn't rush towards the ball, just stood still and caught it with both hands with an air of calmness.

Marizanne Kapp to Richa Ghosh, 1 run, Marizanne Kapp stares and that is not something you want to see as a South African supporter. She is livid as she walks away from the crease. It's a full toss on the stumps and Richa has mistimed the slog straight to Bosch at deep square. Bosch ran in, got both hands and failed to hang onto it. How costly will this prove? Remember, Bosch dropped Shafali earlier as well. The umpires check for a possible no-ball and it is well below the waist. Not a no ball...

Chips the drive back at the bowler and de Klerk takes a fantastic one-handed catch to her right. Deepti Sharma got in the way and almost barged into the bowler, but de Klerk kept her eyes on the ball and never lost the grip despite a glacing blow to Deepti's shoulder.

Loud appeal for leg before and umpire Jacqueline Williams says no. South Africa review. Looks like the ball hit Amanjot on the back of her left arm. Impact outside off and that will remain not out. South Africa lose a review...

Vijay: India should make sure to get to 300, anything above is an advantage. In a final 300 is a daunting task, just because India chased the other night, it ain't gonna happen every time. Should not loose the plot by aiming for 350.

Deepti Sharma given out lbw, but this looks to have pitched outside leg stump. Should be not out. Nothing on UltraEdge. Pitched outside leg as expected. Umpire Jacqueline Williams will have to reverse her verdict....

33.1
Chloe Tryon to Kaur, 1 run, Deepti Sharma is not a great runner and has to put in a full-length dive to get in, also it was played with soft hands and wide of backward point, Tumi Sekhukhune comes in and puts in a weak throw on the bounce to Sinalo Jafta, better throw and Deepti was in trouble. She then gives the thumbs up to Harman
Chloe Tryon [4.0-0-25-1] is back into the attack
STAT: Before today, Deepti had scored 40 off 83 (1 dismissal, SR: 48.19) vs Kapp in ODIs. The six she hit in the previous over was the first off Kapp in the tournament.
Time for some cool drinks. Or whatever you prefer. South Africa squeezing and the move to get Khaka back worked. She bowled stump to stump and frustrated Shafali first and then Jemimah. Got her both and the last 30 minutes has been excellent for them. India understandably cautious after the double-blow. They would look to build another stand before setting up the platform for the last 10 overs. Anything under 300 would be very tough to defend on this, especially if dew which is expected, comes in.
Laura Wolvaardt: There is a reason why South Africa are playing their third successive ICC final in the women's game. A major share of that credit must go to Laura, the batter and the skipper of course. She is one of those players who never loses her cool. Her best bowler Kapp struggled for rhythm and Khaka found it tough to control the swing. Shafali got dropped and the bowling looked a bit lackadaisical at times. Imagine what it must be like an opponent skipper witnessing all of it amidst the sea of blue. Not once did Laura panic. She kept communicating with her bowlers, and now pulled off a clutch catch (inches off the ground) to dismiss the semi-final centurion (Jemimah). Laura's calmness comes from her hunger to excel at academics (7 distinctions in her final year of school) from a very young age. While breaking records as a batter is her favourite routine as a cricketer, she also loves playing the guitar and writing songs. No wonder Hashim Amla - one of the coolest cricketers of all-times - is her cricketing idol.

Ayabonga Khaka to Rodrigues, out Caught by Wolvaardt!! Wolvaardt is claiming that at cover. It's a low catch and they are going upstairs. Fingers are down and they are under the ball says the third ump. She wants some other angle. This one is pixelated she feels. Gone. Clearly fingers under the ball. Three dots and Rodrigues picks out cover. Full outside off, she times the cover drive but can't keep it down, it's a good low catch as the South Africa captain has the fingers under the ball. The third ump is happy after a couple of angles. In the end just caught with the left hand even though initially Wolvaardt went with two hands. Rodrigues c Wolvaardt b Ayabonga Khaka 24(37) [4s-1]
Ayabonga Khaka to Rodrigues, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
Santhosh: India must look to replicate the cliched 'double your 30 overs score' template today. Given how the pitch is a batting paradise and how tough defending at the D.Y Patil can be, chasing anything in excess of 300 in an ICC final will still be a daunting task for SA!

Ayabonga Khaka to Shafali Verma, out Caught by Luus!! That last ball they took just one and now we see Shafali Verma hole out to mid-off. That's what good fielding can do. So so crucial in any format. Credit to Nadine de Klerk and Luus for keeping it to one last ball and also we have to say it was poor running. Shafali tried to loft a similar length delivery outside the leg-stump this over, almost holed out, this time she finds the reverse-cupped hands of Luus at mid-off. Sharp catch and that drop by Bosch has cost South Africa 31 runs. Bosch would be the one who would be most relieved. Just a bit more elevation from Shafali as she made room to loft and she would have got four. Still a fine knock and it has come in a World Cup final.

Did Anneke Bosch just drop the World Cup? It could be too early to say such a bold statement, but you don't drop players like Shafali whose game is built on dominating opponents with power hitting. There is a reason why she is the youngest debutant (In T20s - 15 years 239 days) for India till date. She brings that "X" factor into play and when the selectors decided to pick Pratika over Shafali, a major section of the India fans were not happy despite Pratika's improved consistency. Who doesn't love the unpredictability factor and all the thrills associated with it? For someone so young, it must have been incredibly difficult mentally knowing that you won't be part of the home World Cup - a dream for any cricketer. While some struggle to cope with the heartbreaks, the others use those setbacks to rise like a phoenix. Shafali, surely, is the latter. The omission did not deter her one bit. She kept playing for her domestic side (Haryana) and averaged 75.28 at a strike rate of 152.31 in the 2024-25 season. She was also the 4th highest run-getter in WPL 2025 and regularly featured in the India "A" games throughout the year. During this time, she worked on rotating strike and focused on hitting straight rather than going for the cross-bat slogs. She was dropped by Bosch on 56. While some might count that as luck, Shafali might consider that as a reward for all the hardwork she put in after being left out from the ODI side. She now looks in the mood to take on anything remotely poor (line and length) from the bowlers. Ominous signs for South Africa.

Raj: "Do you think they should up the tempo a little bit? Only one wicket down yet the run rate is under 6." -- Good thing about this partnership is that they're not consuming too many dots. Just 9 dots out of 40 so far. Going at a pretty brisk rate too.

A big opening stand and that's broken. The length was a tad too full for the shot. Smriti c Sinalo Jafta b Chloe Tryon 45(58) [4s-8]
Chloe Tryon to Smriti, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
STAT: This is the second pair to put on a century stand in the Women’s WC final after Rachael Haynes and Alyssa Healy had added 160 against England in the 2022 final.

16.1
Luus to Shafali Verma, no run, tossed up full on off, Shafali Verma gets forward to flick to mid-wicket
Sune Luus, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
Drinks are on the field now! It's a terrific start from the two openers, especially Shafali who was brilliant against the new ball, using her feet and disrupting the rhythm of the seamers. Never allowed them to settle and caused plenty of headaches. India raced to 63/0 after 9 overs. South Africa have somewhat pulled the rate back with the introduction of Mlaba and de Klerk but India have bossed this opening phase of play. Pitch has played well and wasn't too sticky to start off despite the rain.

Mlaba to Smriti, FOUR, oh that's too easy. So much width, so much time on the back foot and only one fielder to beat at backward point. She can do that with her eyes closed, such is her mastery in that region. Opens the face, cuts late and the ball races away

Mlaba to Shafali Verma, 2 runs, outstanding effort from Dercksen in the deep! Saves a couple of runs! Tossed up outside off, Shafali dances down right to the pitch, drives crisply and it's racing through extra cover. Takes a full stretch dive from sweeper cover to cut it off and Dercksen is up to the challenge
13.1
Mlaba to Shafali Verma, no run, good length ball on off, Shafali goes back and punches down the pitch
Smriti, the best student of the game: The best students of the game are those who work hard on not repeating their mistakes. When India played South Africa in the group stages (in Vizag), Smriti defended a full toss against Mlaba first ball  (first over after the powerplay) and got out next ball (ran down the pitch looking to hit a maximum - only to be caught at long-off). Today, Mlaba was introduced quite early as the pacers struggled for control. And when a left-arm spinner bowls to a left-hander inside the powerplay, there is always a great amount of temptation for the big hit with only 2 fielders outside the circle. Smriti, however, looked absolutely unhurried while facing Mlaba in the 8th over. Although she got a couple of leg-stump deliveries, she seemed keen on just negating it into the leg-side with soft hands. With India in the driver's seat from the onset, there is no need to take any extra risks - a lesson all the aspiring cricketers can learn from one of the game's finest - Smriti Mandhana.

de Klerk to Smriti, no run, tighter over from de Klerk. Keeps it at the stumps, length fuller this time and Smriti prods forward in defence. A single off the previous over and now a single off this one. South Africa needed this kind of control desperately

de Klerk to Shafali Verma, 1 run, short of length delivery in the channel, Shafali hangs back and punches through cover
STAT: India's highest score after first 10 overs in a World Cup game (where ball-by-ball data available). This pair had added 68 in this phase against the same opponent in a must-win game in Christchurch in 2022.
10.3

10.1
de Klerk to Shafali Verma, no run, goes for a big shot but hasn't timed it! Fuller than a good length on off, her idea is to go over mid-on as she swings hard but is probably late on it. Mistimes it along the ground to the fielder
STAT: Heading into this game, SA had conceded at 3.93 RPO in the first 10 overs in this tournament, much better than the next best (4.41 for Australia).
Just like her idol: Shafali Verma is a huge fan of Virender Sehwag. We all know what Sehwag did the whole tournament (ODI WC) in 2011 - aim to hit the first ball for a four. Looks like Shafali has come out with a similar intent to dominate today. After being left out from the World Cup squad initially and then a failure against Australia in the semi-final, she sure has more than a point to prove. She looks in decent touch so far and is looking to find a boundary in the first 2 balls of an over (whenever she gets an opportunity to take strike). Not a good sign if you are a South African supporter.

Nerves of a final? Marizanne Kapp played 5 finals (2 in the T20 World Cup and 3 in WPL) in the last 3 years and have ended up on the runners up side on each of those occasions. She also considered retirement before the 2024 World Cup. Today when the South African national anthem was played, she looked very emotional and also shed a few tears, probably soaking it all since her international debut in March 2009 (against Australia). She is one player who has the ability to dismantle oppositions with her swing and wobble. England had no answers to her bowling in the semi-final. Today, however, she is struggling to find her rhythm and getting less movement than her new-ball partner Khaka. It's the least amount (1.1 degree) of movement she got in the whole tournament. The average movement she got the whole tournament was 1.5 degrees.

Marizanne Kapp to Shafali Verma, FOUR, flicked off the pads and it teases the chasing fielder into the boundary! A flier for Shafali at the top! Has raced to 21 off just 12 and is disrupting the rhythm with her constant use of feet. This time, though, she stays in the crease with the keeper up to the stumps and pounces on the error in line. It's on the pads and she flicks it through midwicket
Now keeper up to the stumps for Kapp as well. Shafali causing a few headaches.
4.2
4
Marizanne Kapp to Shafali Verma, FOUR, this is a bright start from Shafali! Advances down with a lot of confidence, finds it on a good length and still has the conviction to go through with the drive despite not being to the pitch. Gorgeously stroked on the up through cover
4.1
Marizanne Kapp to Smriti, 1 run, pitched up on off, Smriti drives well but doesn't find the gap as Brits makes a sliding stop at extra cover
Why do the keepers stand upto the stumps against pacers? To stop the batters from standing outside the crease and thereby, restricting their shuffle movements down the track which increases the probability of a lbw/bowled/caught-behind and might also force the batters to play with all-hands approach.

4
Ayabonga Khaka to Shafali Verma, FOUR, almost every ball she's advancing down, maybe to negate the inswinger. And the wristwork is brilliant on this occasion. Inswinger on the pads, Shafali picks it up and whips it behind square
Shuffle-Shafali: In case you are new to cricket - one of the many tactics that batters use to counter the moving ball is by advancing down the pitch or standing a good few inches outside the crease. More effective against the incoming delivery. So far, Shafali seemed keen on using her feet to both the bowlers so far. While she hit Khaka for a boundary, she managed to push the ball wide of cover to pinch a quick single off her first ball off Kapp.

Ayabonga Khaka to Shafali Verma, FOUR, Shafali is down the track straightaway! And she gets the scoreboard ticking for India! Takes a couple of steps down the pitch, goes after this length ball outside off and punches it through the gap at point. Despite the rain we've had, there's no stopping it
Ayabonga Khaka, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
First impressions of the pitch: Well if you are an Indian fan, it's a massive sigh of relief as Kapp didn't find much movement in the opening over. There were 2 slips in place for the first 2 balls, but Kapp asked her skipper to remove the second slip and strengthen the off-side ring. Smriti, too, didn't look hurried. She knew there would be some swing on offer and played a bit cautiously.
