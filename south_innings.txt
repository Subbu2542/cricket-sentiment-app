Deepti Sharma to de Klerk, out Caught by Kaur!! India are champions for the very first time! A moment that promises to change the lives not just of the 11 on the field, but millions off it too. The fireworks go off at the DY Patil as the players come charging from every direction before melting in each other's arms. They've been through it all, from a struggle for recognition to the pinnacle of the sport. And it's captain Harmanpreet who puts the finishing touches. Full toss, de Klerk swings, slices it in the air and Harman leaps at extra cover to grab it with both hands. More than a billion people leap with her. de Klerk c Kaur b Deepti Sharma 18(19) [4s-3]

Shree Charani to de Klerk, out Ayabonga Khaka Run Out!! South Africa have gifted this wicket. Just when India were starting to feel the pressure, Khaka is run out in an attempt to keep de Klerk on strike for the next over. Steered to backward point, not wide enough of the fielder and they go through for the single anyway. Throw comes in flat next to the stumps, the bails are whipped off and Khaka is short of her ground. Ayabonga Khaka run out (Deepti Sharma/Richa Ghosh) 1(7)

Renuka Singh to de Klerk, no run, this would've sealed it but Jemi puts it down! Oh the nerves! She has barely put a step wrong on the field all tournament but coming so close to the pinnacle brings with it the jitters.

Fired in full on middle and leg, zips through off the surface, beats Tryon on the flick and hammers the front pad. India know it the moment that thud is heard. The umpire obliges too, and ball-tracking says it's clipping leg stump. Chloe Tryon lbw b Deepti Sharma 9(8) [4s-1]

Deepti Sharma to Wolvaardt, out Caught by Amanjot Kaur!! Amanjot hangs on for dear life on the third attempt! For dear life! An attempted slog-sweep from Wolvaardt, gets a lot of height but not much distance and the ball goes high up before descending at deep midwicket. It's Amanjot there - one of India's best on the field. And she nearly makes a mess of it. The ball pops out, she has a juggle.. once, twice and holds on with the third attempt. She collapses to the floor in relief and a couple of teammates collapse right on top of her. A huge wicket in the final, the South African captain departs.

Time for drinks. The last 40 minutes were all India but those last two sixes and with Wolvaardt still being there gives South Africa hope. As long as their skipper is there and with Tryon and de Klerk to come, South Africa will believe. Also there is dew out there now. A real test of who holds their nerves will determine who will win. Time to hand over comms to the finisher extraordinaire, the scarcely believable, my esteemed colleague - Sagar Chawla who will end this.

Deepti Sharma to Sinalo Jafta, out Caught by Radha Yadav!! Sinalo Jafta falls in an attempt to up the rate. She comes down the track but gets too close to the pitch to a tossed up delivery outside off, drags it off a thick inside half and Radha is almost at a short mid-on, she is so straight. Simple catch that. India celebrate. Sinalo Jafta c Radha Yadav b Deepti Sharma 16(29) [4s-1]

So, why do captains turn to a part-time bowler? Usually, when there isn't too much assistance for the regular bowlers, captains have this tendency to bring in a part-time bowler for two reasons. 1 - If they end up bowling a few tight overs, that helps the captain have extra options at the death. 2 - To hope for a change in luck and lure the batters into playing a silly shot. It may not be a successful tactic all the time, but cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties and part-time bowlers have a proven track record of creating a telling impact on the game. With Luus and Wolvaardt finding a boundary every over, Harmapreet turned to Shafali and that move is working wonders so far. So slow was the ball against Luus and she ended up playing it a little harder and earlier than she would have liked. Not only did Shafali break the vital partnership, but also picked up the highly-experienced wicket of Kapp, becoming the first player to score a fifty and claim 2 wickets in the final of Women's World Cup while at it.

Time for drinks. The game is nicely poised at the moment. South Africa started well and gave a needless wicket away with Brits running well away from the crease and diagonally. Bosch was nipped out early but Wolvaardt is the key for her side. She looks very determined out there. As of now can't see much dew.
India, much better in the field today: In the semi-final against Australia, India dropped a few catches and were sloppy in the field, conceding a few overthrows in the process. Looks like they have learnt their lessons from that game. Brits got out caught and bowled by Kranti Goud in Vizag in the league stage and the Indian skipper was smart enough to keep a silly mid-on in place for most part of her innings. Brits has this tendency to play with high hands and that brings the inside edge into play against the incoming delivery. When she got run out, the ball actually pinged the inside half before sneaking towards Amanjot, the best fielder for India so far, at mid-wicket. Did you know Amanjot had an injury scare before the World Cup and she refused to reveal it to her parents fearing stress and anxiety. Before the start of the game today, when she was asked about the rehabilitation, this is what the all-rounder had to say: "I think I'm pretty used to it now (talking about injury, rehabilitation and what it meant to her family), but my family isn't. They still don't know I was injured (before the WC). So I told them I'm going for a high performance camp. So they were like, why are you only going for the high performance camp? Or why are you being rested? Why isn't Harman being rested or Jemi? So I said, no, I was special. So I have to go for a high performance camp. So now by the media or by the interviews, they'll get to know that I was injured. But I am very grateful for the opportunities I've got and I've literally grabbed every bit of it. So just hoping for the best for now."

Shree Charani to Bosch, out Lbw!! End of a miserable day for Bosch. Also the entire tournament has been a nightmare for her. Did it pitch in line? Looked like it. Yes it did as ball-tracking is in now. Anyway Bosch as soon as she misses, walks. Then has a chat with Wolvaardt and then on she goes. A length delivery on leg and middle, Bosch flicks all around it, simple delivery and somehow Bosch has missed that. Plumb in front and umpire Jacqueline Williams has no issues as she raises her finger. That is crashing into the stumps. Shree Charani strikes in her first over. Bosch lbw b Shree Charani 0(6)

Renuka Singh to Tazmin Brits, out Tazmin Brits Run Out!! Poor running from Brits. What was she doing running diagonally. A straight line would have probably got her in. A slower-ball on a length on middle, nudged off the back foot to the left of mid-wicket, Amanjot comes around and fires a direct-hit. Brits doesn't dive - the wide path makes her short of the crease. She tried to slide the bat in. India are elated and why not. There was Renuka in the way, but she could have easily avoided her. Also she played that off the back foot. India break the opening stand which was causing them some issues. Tazmin Brits run out (Amanjot Kaur) 23(35) [4s-2 6s-1]
